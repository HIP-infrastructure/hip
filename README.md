### Publish the app

On the master branch, `npm run publish` will produce a Nextcloud app, compiling all assets, css, images and JS code into a static folder and create a templates/index.php which refers to the build.

The package can then be deployed as a NextCloud app by moving the hip folder inside nextcloud/apps/hip

`make deploy`on the frontend package will also create the production version, based on React production assets.
